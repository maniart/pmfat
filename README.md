This website is a project by artist, critic and curator Mohammad Salemy that uses an abbreviated version of the french collective Tiqqun's Preliminary Notes For a Theory of the Young Girl as a template towards instant generation of theoretical text.
By changing a few parameters within the original text, users can refocus the critical lens embedded in this seminal text towards other subjects.
